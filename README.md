## Main Branch
### HTML ###
Here goes all the structural files (currently one). The main goal is make a one
page web, where all the sections are actually in the same HTML file.
### CSS
We are running only vanilla CSS (but in the future where going to mash up with
SASS). The objective is create a simple and pretty first CSS stylesheet.
### JS
Minimal and functional JS. Again, all make in the house, like grandma does.
